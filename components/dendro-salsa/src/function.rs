///
/// * the `fetch` method, which is invoked when the function is called by the user's code;
///   it will return a memoized value if one exists, or execute the function otherwise.
/// * the `specify` method, which can only be used when the key is an entity created by the active query.
///   It sets the value of the function imperatively, so that when later fetches occur, they'll return this value.
/// * the `store` method, which can only be invoked with an `&mut` reference, and is to set input fields.
